# Get-SPOItemPermissions.ps1

## Overview

`Get-SPOItemPermissions.ps1` is a comprehensive PowerShell script for scanning SharePoint Online (SPO) sites to enumerate all files and folders, collecting detailed permissions informationâ€”who has access, their roles, and whether permissions are inherited or unique. Results are exported to an Excel file for easy auditing and review.

  - Roles assigned
  - Inherited vs. unique permissions
  - Creator and creation date
- Outputs:
  - Excel file with all item permissions
  - Log file documenting script activity
  - Optional summary worksheet

1. **PowerShell Modules** (installed automatically if missing):
   - [ImportExcel](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel)
   - [PnP.PowerShell](https://github.com/pnp/powershell)
2. **App Registration** in Entra ID (Azure AD):
   - Permissions: `Sites.FullControl.All` recommended
   - Certificate-based authentication (App ID, Thumbprint, Tenant ID)

## Configuration

Edit the top of the script to provide:

```powershell
# --- Tenant and App Registration Details ---
$appID = "your-app-id"                  # Entra App ID
$thumbprint = "your-cert-thumbprint"    # Certificate thumbprint
$tenant = "your-tenant-id"              # Tenant ID

# --- Input File Path ---
$inputFilePath = 'C:\temp\SPOSiteList.txt'  # Path to site URLs file

# --- Script Behavior Settings (optional) ---
$batchSize = 100
$maxItemsPerSheet = 5000
```

---

## Usage

1. **Edit configuration variables** near the top of the script.
2. **Prepare the input file:** List SPO site URLs, one per line.
3. **Run the script:**

   ```powershell
   .\Get-SPOItemPermissions.ps1
   ```

   (Run from an elevated PowerShell prompt if needed.)

4. **Results:**
   - Excel file: `%TEMP%\All_Item_Permissions_[timestamp].xlsx`
   - Log file: `%TEMP%\All_Item_Permissions_[timestamp].txt`
   - Excel file will open automatically if possible.

## Notes

- The script automatically skips known system folders and lists for efficiency and accuracy.
- Handles SPO throttling gracefully with exponential backoff.
- No command-line parameters; all config is in the script.
- Review and update `$appID`, `$thumbprint`, `$tenant`, and `$inputFilePath` before use.
